EXECUTION
*Upload dataset into hdf than insert it into table.
 (I done it with Ambari Hive View Upload Table. Don`t do it, if you done it for hivehw1.)
*Change execution engine in Hive View setings betwin tez and mr to compare result and execution time.
If you want execute queries on spark engine, you will execut it on Zeppelin noutebook,
because you cant set spark like executin engine in settings of Ambari Hive View on that version. 
All queries in file 2.txt 
All screenshots and results in folder.
Also screenshots can be something like a guid, how to run queries.
How many MR jobs where instanced for this query? About this you can read on logs screenshots for tez and mr engines.
